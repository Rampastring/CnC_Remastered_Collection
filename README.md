This is my personal version in which i've improved the AI in RA.
It handles his cash flow and building priorities & limits a lot smarter.

Also it doesn't wait for the player to let his base grow and/or tech up to the highest level.
The more cash on the map available, the harder it is to beat this AI.

Oh,
And it uses the Naval stuff to. :-)
